  <h1>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
  <h2>📏 Rules</h2>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🎯 Goal:</strong>
    Win three small boards in a row to win the big board!
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>📦 Setup:</strong>
    Draw a 3×3 grid of Tic-Tac-Toe boards — each small board has its own 3×3 layout.
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🔁 Turn Order:</strong>
    Players take turns marking X or O on any open cell in one of the small boards.
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>📍 Targeting Rule:</strong>
    Your move sends your opponent to a specific board — the position you choose inside your board determines which board they must play on next.
    <br><br>
    For example: If you play in the top-right cell, your opponent must play in the top-right small board.
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🚫 Closed Board:</strong>
    If the target board is already won or full, your opponent may play in any open board.
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🏆 Winning a Board:</strong>
    Win a small board using normal Tic-Tac-Toe rules (3 in a row).
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🥇 Winning the Game:</strong>
    Be the first player to win 3 small boards in a row on the big board.
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🔒 Drawn Boards:</strong>
    If a small board ends in a draw, no one gets it — treat it as a locked square.
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <strong>🧠 Strategy Tip:</strong>
    Think ahead — you’re not just playing your move, you’re choosing your opponent’s next challenge!
  </div>
