  <h1>Silent UNO</h1>
  <p><strong>Players:</strong> 2‚Äì10<br>
     <strong>Time:</strong> 15‚Äì30 minutes<br>
     <strong>Ages:</strong> 8+<br>
     <strong>Type:</strong> Card / Stealth Variant / No Talking</p>

  <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
  <p>Be the first player to play all your cards ‚Äî but <strong>without saying a word</strong>, including ‚ÄúUNO!‚Äù</p>

  <h2>RULE CHANGES FROM CLASSIC UNO</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>NO TALKING ALLOWED</strong><br>No verbal communication, gestures, or mouthing words. No calling ‚ÄúUNO.‚Äù</li>
    <li><strong>SILENT UNO RULE</strong><br>When you have 1 card left, silently place a special card face-down in front of you as your secret UNO signal.</li>
    <li><strong>CHALLENGING SILENT UNO</strong><br>If someone has 1 card and gave no signal, ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù them.<br>Correct = they draw 2 cards. Incorrect = you draw 2 cards.</li>
    <li><strong>ACTION CARDS STILL APPLY</strong><br>All classic action cards are used ‚Äî silently.</li>
    <li><strong>BREAKING SILENCE = PENALTY</strong><br>If anyone speaks or signals, they draw 2 penalty cards.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>SILENT UNO PENALTY SYSTEM</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tap table = challenge</li>
    <li>Raise hand = silent accusation</li>
    <li>Spoke out loud = draw 2 cards</li>
    <li>Failed UNO signal = draw 2 cards</li>
    <li>False challenge = challenger draws 2 cards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîï HOW TO ENFORCE PENALTIES IN SILENT UNO</h2>

  <h3>1. Tapping or Buzzing</h3>
  <p>If a player breaks a rule, another player can tap the table once or twice loudly (like a buzzer sound).<br>
  This serves as a universal ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù or ‚Äúpenalty alert.‚Äù</p>

  <h3>2. Raising a Hand or Finger</h3>
  <p>The first person to raise a hand (or a single index finger) alerts the group that a rule was broken.<br>
  Optional: use this ONLY for silent UNO challenges (e.g., failure to silently signal UNO).</p>

  <h3>3. Using a Rule Challenge Card or Token (Optional)</h3>
  <p>Each player starts with one ‚Äúchallenge card‚Äù or ‚Äúflag token.‚Äù<br>
  To accuse someone of a rule break, they silently place this token/card in front of them.<br>
  If they're right, the accused draws 2 cards. If wrong, the challenger draws 2.</p>

  <h3>4. How to Handle Disputes (Silently)</h3>
  <p>Establish a moderator or referee (rotates each round) who confirms penalty calls without speaking.<br>
  Alternatively, allow a single player to write a challenge on a small whiteboard or notepad if there's uncertainty.</p>

  <h2>ENDING AND WINNING</h2>
  <p>First to discard all cards wins the round.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use standard UNO scoring, or tally wins</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>NOTES</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a token card as silent UNO signal</li>
    <li>Great for family, classroom, or camp</li>
  </ul>
