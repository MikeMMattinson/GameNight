## 📁 Folder Structure

- Each game has its **own folder** with:
  - `rules.md` or `README.md`
  - Printable PDFs or images
  - Any special dice/cards/components

- The `/contents/index.html` file is auto-generated and reflects the same list.

- A global `styles.css` and `images/` folder support consistent styling.
