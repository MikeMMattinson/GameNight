    <h1>UNO</h1>

    <p><strong>Players:</strong> 2–10</p>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> 15–30 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 7+</p>
    <p><strong>Type:</strong> Card / Matching / Family</p>

    <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
    <p>Be the first player to score 500 points by discarding all your cards and earning points from opponents' remaining cards.</p>

    <h2>🧰 Setup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle the 108-card deck and deal 7 cards to each player.</li>
        <li>Place the rest face-down as the draw pile.</li>
        <li>Flip the top card to start the discard pile (apply action effect if needed).</li>
        <li>Player to dealer’s left goes first; play proceeds clockwise.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🃏 Card Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number cards</strong>: 0–9 in red, green, blue, yellow</li>
        <li><strong>Action cards</strong> (same colors):
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skip</strong>: next player loses their turn</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse</strong>: reverses turn order</li>
                <li><strong>Draw Two</strong>: next player draws 2 and misses a turn</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wild cards</strong> (black):
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wild</strong>: choose a new color</li>
                <li><strong>Wild Draw Four</strong>: choose a color and next player draws 4 cards<br><em>(only if you have no matching colors)</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔁 Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Play a card that matches the discard pile by number, color, or symbol.</li>
        <li>If you can’t play, draw one card. If it’s playable, you may play it immediately.</li>
        <li>Optional: you may draw even if you have a playable card.</li>
        <li>Use action and wild cards to change the flow.</li>
        <li>When you have <strong>one card left</strong>, you <strong>must shout “UNO!”</strong> before ending your turn.
            <ul><li>If caught failing to do so, draw 2 penalty cards.</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏁 Ending a Round</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Round ends when one player discards their last card.</li>
        <li>That player scores based on cards left in opponents’ hands:
            <ul>
                <li>Number cards = face value</li>
                <li>Action cards = 20 points</li>
                <li>Wild cards = 50 points</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🏆 Ending and Winning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First player to reach <strong>500 points</strong> wins</li>
        <li>Or: play multiple rounds and declare the winner by:
            <ul>
                <li>Most rounds won</li>
                <li>Lowest total score</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝 Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use house rules to customize stacking and draw penalties</li>
        <li>For quicker games, reduce the point goal (e.g. 200 or 300)</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Rule (optional):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If you suspect a Wild Draw Four was played illegally, challenge it!</li>
                <li>If the player was bluffing, they draw 4 cards instead of you.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
